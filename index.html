    <h1>I Want My Hat Back (Hardcover)</h1>
    By <a href="#">Jon Klassen </a>
    4.5 stars (346 reviews)
    <br><br>
    <span class="bold"><p>A <em>New York Times</em> Best Illustrated Children's Book of 2011</p>
   <p> A picture-book delight by a rising talent tells a cumulative tale with a mischievous twist.</p></span>
    <br>
    <p>
        The bear's hat is gone, and he wants it back. 
        Patiently and politely, he asks the animals he comes across, 
        one by one, whether they have seen it. Each animal says no, 
        some more elaborately than others. But just as the bear begins to despond, 
        a deer comes by and asks a simple question that sparks the bear's memory and renews his search with a vengeance. 
        Told completely in dialogue, 
        this delicious take on the classic repetitive tale plays out in sly illustrations laced with visual humor - 
        and winks at the reader with a wry irreverence that will have kids of all ages thrilled to be in on the joke.

    <h4><span class="bold">Hilarious for kids and adults</span></h2>
    <p>By <a href="#">paperparent</a> on 13th January 2023</p>
    <p>We received this book as a Christmas gift, and both my three and five year old love it! Delightfully simple yet hilarious, with beautiful illustrations, it's also one that I don't mind reading over and over again at bedtime!</p>
    <p>5 stars</p>

    <h4><span class="bold">It's a bear necessity!</span></h4>
    <p>By <a href="#">animal_lover22</a> on 21th June 2022</p>
    <p>I bought this book for my daughter, but I ended up buying two more copies for my kindergarten classes. The humour is tongue-in-cheek yet accessible to young children. It's a clear favourite, and the kids now know it so well that they read along and cheer when we get to "WAIT! I HAVE SEEN MY HAT!!!".</p>
    <p>3 stars</p>

    <h4><span class="bold">Not sure about the ending</span></h4>
    <p>By <a href="#">camlow</a> on 22th July 2022</p>
    <p>There's something to be said for the illustrations and dead-pan humour of this book. However, the ending could be a little disturbing for younger kids (I had to reread the book to make sure I understood what had happened). It's up to parents to judge whether this book would be suitable for their children.</p>
