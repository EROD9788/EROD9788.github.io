Join a Brisbane City Photo Safari

There's more than meets the eye in Brisbane City. But perfect for the camera. From King George Square to Mount Cootha, from the Kurilpa Bridge to Southbank, Photo Safaris are unique photo classes for small groups & individuals who want to learn how to capture the allure that's distinctly Brisvegas. While using BNE as both backdrop and classroom, these photography workshops provide unique photographic opportunities to sharpen your skills and capture memories for a lifetime. Groups are small, so you’ll get hands on instruction on how to use your camera and compose your pictures from an experienced professional photographer.
